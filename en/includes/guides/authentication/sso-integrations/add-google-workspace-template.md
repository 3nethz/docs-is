## Try it out

Now, you have successfully configured Google and {{ product_name }}.

!!! note
    The admin users of your Google domain do not get redirected to WSO2 IS.
    Therefore, to try out the tutorial you need to use a user who is not an
    admin in your Google account.

1. Create a user in {{ product_name }}. Make sure that the same user
   exists in your Google domain.  
   In this example, `alex@wso2support.com`
   is in the Google domain. Therefore, we need to create the same user in {{ product_name }}.

2. Navigate to [http://accounts.google.com](http://accounts.google.com)
   and enter the email address of the user you created.  
   You are navigated to {{ product_name }}'s sign in screen.
3. Enter the username and password of the user you created.  
   You are navigated to the G-Suite of that domain and you can select
   the application you need to use.

!!! note
    If you want to only access Gmail, navigate to
    [mail.google.com](http://mail.google.com), enter the username of the
    user, enter the username and password of the user on the {{ product_name }}
    sign in screen, and you are navigated to the user's mail account.

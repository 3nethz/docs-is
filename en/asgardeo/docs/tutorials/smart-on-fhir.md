# SMART on FHIR

Follow the tutorial below to learn about how you can leverage Asgardeo to implement a robust authentication and authorization mechanism for your healthcare application built on SMART on FHIR.

## What is SMART on FHIR?

[FHIR](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/index.html){target="_blank"} (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is a standard introduced by HL7 for securely exchanging healthcare data. The standard defines a set of structured data formats for key healthcare resources such as patients, practitioners, diagnostics and medications. This ensures that regardless of how the data are stored in one system, they can be understood and processed by another system even if it is running on a different technology.

[SMART ON FHIR](https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/index.html){target="_blank"} is a framework that extends FHIR and allows third-party developers to create applications that seamlessly integrate with Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems. There are two main advantages of using SMART ON FHIRE for building healthcare apps:

- Interoperability - As the framework provides a standardized method to access healthcare data, developers can build applications that work across different EHR systems, irrespective of the underlying technology.

- Security - The framework uses open standards such as OAuth2 and OpenID Connect for authorization and authentication to ensure EHR systems are accessed securely and in compliance with privacy regulations such as HIPAA.

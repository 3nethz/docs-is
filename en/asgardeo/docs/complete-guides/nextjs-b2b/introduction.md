## Introduction

In today's business landscape, organizations need efficient ways to manage their teams, control access to resources, and handle user permissions across different organizational units. Building a B2B application that handles these requirements securely and efficiently can be challenging.

This guide demonstrates how to build a comprehensive B2B team management application using **Next.js** and **Asgardeo**. The application enables users to create and switch into teams, send user invitations, and manage access levels, all while maintaining security best practices.

## Why Next.js and Asgardeo?

Next.js provides:

- Server-side rendering for better performance
- API routes to create backend functionality without a separate server
- Built-in TypeScript support
- Efficient routing system
- OOTB (Out-of-the-box) production-grade performance

Asgardeo offers:

- Secure authentication and authorization 
- Robust B2B identity management
- Organization hierarchy management
- Built-in user management
- Role-based access control
- Organization and application-specific UI branding

## Use Case

Let's explore a brief B2B use case to set the context for this guide.

`Teamspace` is a sample application designed to demonstrate a B2B scenario where organizations, or in this case, teams, can manage their teams efficiently. The app provides functionalities for handling multiple teams, switching between teams, and adding new teams dynamically.

B2B application overview:

![B2B app overview]({{base_path}}/complete-guides/nextjs-b2b/assets/img/image1.png){: width="500" style="display: block; margin: auto;"}

In a B2B scenario, organizations often need a structured way to manage different teams within their hierarchy. We will learn how to add the following features into a B2B application.

- User registration
- Create and switch into multiple teams under the parent team or app.
- Invite users to teams

Your final application will look something like this:

![B2B app final]({{base_path}}/complete-guides/nextjs-b2b/assets/img/image2.png){: width="800" style="display: block; margin: 0;"}

## Steps Taken in the Implementation

1. Register an application in Asgardeo
2. Give access to API resources and create roles
3. Create a Next.js app
4. Configure Asgardeo Provider
5. Add login and logout 
6. Add user registration
7. Manage teams
8. Invite members
